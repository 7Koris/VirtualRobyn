A virtual fox named Robyn that lives on your taskbar.
Original project: https://github.com/blindbandit76/virtual_pet

### Description
VirtualRobyn is a desktop pet application built in Godot 4. This project is a fork of another project; the logic dictating character states has been rewritten to support state weights to make some animation states more likely than others. A simple dialog system has been implemented as well.

### Usage
* Simply run the executable
